The purpose of this folder is to be used as a dummy network to remind me how to use NN's.

helper_functions.py: A set of helper functions for various image processing steps
train.py: The main training code for this
parameters.??: The hyperparameters for the training and other various things

Note: the JSON params.json is:
dx width of 'voxel' (dim1)
dy height of 'voxel' (dim2)
dz depth of 'voxel' (dim3)

Process: 
First generate the base images -> done
Generate the script that turns it into labelled data -> in progress


Set up the CNN architecture and verify that things can be fed through
Set up the training process code with validation stuff

Generate labelled data pipeline
