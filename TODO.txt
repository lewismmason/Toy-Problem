This document contains the things I need to do going forward with the project.

TODO: 
* Get 2D SUSAN to work for 16 bit (will give better results)
* Get the 3D susan and test it for PDF and binarizations
* GET training to work on GPU


Could not get the TIF file PDF to be as segmented as I would like, still may require using a network. Giving that a shot

Network:
* Get 2D UNET network working using tensorflow and VGG16 weights
* Get set of "bad" training data (current 8bit susan for ground truth)
* Test with 3 phases, void, 4 coated, no coated
* Get the 3D UNET working


General fixes:
* cleanup lol
* use skimage only not PIL (skimage better with TIFs)

Questions:
* none 

NOTES: 
* Depending on whether you are doing a full sheet or thin sheets, the noise gaussian shifts mean*** Just a warning

Forget the section below, synthetic data is likely a waste of time
Synthetic data: Work in 16 bit
**Function that you input indices and it creates phase_i on those. Required for both void and fibers (must also check for N inner boundary values)
**Create phase class that determines how sets of indices are coloured. This class holds edge structure, as well as greyscale gaussian 
*Function that takes input image of binarized fiber and turns it into indices (for ^), 
*Image maker class: this we feed in different phases, and has the functionality for creating the actual images etc
