This document contains the things I need to do going forward with the project.

TODO: 
* Get 2D SUSAN to work for 16 bit (will give better results), maybe not actually
* Get the 3D susan and test it for PDF and binarizations
* GET training to work on GPU (installation issues)
* Make a better validation data generator (fine tuning, removing artifacts, etc)

Network:
* Get 2D UNET network working using tensorflow and VGG16 weights?
* Get set of "bad" training data (current 8bit susan for ground truth)
* Test with 3 phases, void, 4 coated, no coated

This is the proof of concept required for the group

* Get the 3D UNET working
* Get the 3D SUSAN working

* Implement various validation methods to make training data more accurate

General fixes:
* cleanup lol
* use skimage only not PIL (skimage better with TIFs)

Questions

NOTES: 
* Depending on whether you are doing a full sheet or thin sheets, the noise gaussian shifts mean*** Just a warning, may have to consider this by normalizing the main mean to some value
* 2D SUSAN does not separate the sample as well as I would like. Moving to 3D if possible to see if that improves results
* For training data gen don't include void that is close to the fibers (10 voxels?), in case binarization is incorrect (also don't need as many void)
* The purpose for this is that while we can't binerize the fibers correctly, we may be able to pick up some of the additional features close to it by not using all of the data around the fibers to train
* 

Forget the section below, synthetic data is likely a waste of time (it is xd)
Synthetic data: Work in 16 bit
**Function that you input indices and it creates phase_i on those. Required for both void and fibers (must also check for N inner boundary values)
**Create phase class that determines how sets of indices are coloured. This class holds edge structure, as well as greyscale gaussian 
*Function that takes input image of binarized fiber and turns it into indices (for ^), 
*Image maker class: this we feed in different phases, and has the functionality for creating the actual images etc
