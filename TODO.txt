This document contains the thigns I need to do going forward with the project.

What am I doing, why not just susan filter and binerize and train on that for 2D images
we have all the training data already. there is no point. The tool is not the research.


Mock data:

Synthetic data: Work in 16 bit
**Function that you input indices and it creates phase_i on those. Required for both void and fibers (must also check for N inner boundary values)
**Create phase class that determines how sets of indices are coloured. This class holds edge structure, as well as greyscale gaussian 
*Function that takes input image of binarized fiber and turns it into indices (for ^), 

*Image maker class: this we feed in different phases, and has the functionality for creating the actual images etc

Network:
1. Get 2D network up and running for the synthetic data

General fixes:
* cleanup lol
* use skimage only not PIL (skimage better with TIFs)

Questions:
* Is toumas's network working in 3D, or is it analyzing 2D over a full set of images to make a "3D" analysis (I believe 3d 3d)

NOTE: 
* Depending on whether you are doing a full sheet or thin sheets, the noise gaussian shifts mean*** Just a warning
