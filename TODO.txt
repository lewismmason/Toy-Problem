This document contains the things I need to do going forward with the project.

Look at PDF of susan filtered TIF file, currently having issues doing this for 16 bit data. works for 8 bit however.

Network:
Get 2D UNET network working using tensorflow and VGG16 weights



General fixes:
* cleanup lol
* use skimage only not PIL (skimage better with TIFs)

Questions:
* Is toumas's network working in 3D, or is it analyzing 2D over a full set of images to make a "3D" analysis (I believe 3d 3d)

NOTES: 
* Depending on whether you are doing a full sheet or thin sheets, the noise gaussian shifts mean*** Just a warning




Forget the section below, synthetic data is likely a waste of time
Synthetic data: Work in 16 bit
**Function that you input indices and it creates phase_i on those. Required for both void and fibers (must also check for N inner boundary values)
**Create phase class that determines how sets of indices are coloured. This class holds edge structure, as well as greyscale gaussian 
*Function that takes input image of binarized fiber and turns it into indices (for ^), 
*Image maker class: this we feed in different phases, and has the functionality for creating the actual images etc
